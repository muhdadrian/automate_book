# Multiline Strings with Triple Quotes

# while you can use the \n escape character to put a newline into a string, it is often easier to use multiline strings.
# multiline string in Python begins and ends with either three single quotes or three double quotes.
# any quotes, tabs, or newlines in between the "triple quotes" are considered part of the string.
# Python's indentation rules for blocks do not apply to lines inside a multiline string.  

print('''Dear Alice,

Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burglary, and extortion.

Sincerely,
Bob''')

# escaping single and double quotes is optional in multiline strings.
