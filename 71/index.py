# If the value appears multiple times in the list, only the first instance of the value will be removed

spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'cat', 'hat', 'cat']
print(spam) # to ease my restudy
spam.remove('cat')
print(spam) # ['bat', 'rat', 'cat', 'hat', 'cat']

# The del statement is good to use when you know the index of the value you want to remove from the list.

# The remove() method is useful when you know the value you want to remove from the list.
