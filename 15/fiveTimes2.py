# An Equivalent while Loop

# You can actually use a while loop to do the same thing as a for loop; for loops are just more
# concise.

print('My name is')
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')
    i = i + 1

# my code:
# print('My name is')
# i = 0
# while i < 5:
#     print(f"Jimmy Five Times ({i})")
#     i += 1
