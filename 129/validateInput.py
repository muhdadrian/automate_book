# The isX() str methods are helpful when you need to validate user input.

# the following program repeatedly asks users for their age and a password until they provide valid input.

while True:
    print('Enter your age:')
    age = input()
    if age.isdecimal():
        break
    print('Please enter a number for your age.')

while True: 
    print('Select a new password (letters and numbers only):')
    password = input()
    if password.isalnum():
        break
    print('Passwords can only have letters and numbers.')

# first while loop, we ask the user for their age and store their input in age.
# if age is a valid (decimal) value, we break out of this first while loop and move on to the second, which asks for a password.
# otherwise, we inform the user that they need to enter a number and again ask them to enter their age.

# second while loop, we ask for password, store the user's input in password, and break out of the loop if the input was alphanumeric. If it wasn't we're not satisfied, so we tell the user the password needs to be alphanumeric and again ask them to enter a password.
